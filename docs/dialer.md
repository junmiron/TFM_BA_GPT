Certainly! Here’s a summary of the project requirements for the functional specification document:

---

### Executive Summary
- **Overview**: Develop a chatbot system to make phone calls, interact with customers, and determine their interest in purchasing a product. If the customer is interested, the call is transferred to a human agent; otherwise, the chatbot tries to persuade with up to three special offers.
- **Business Benefits**: Streamlines sales efforts, increases productivity, and provides data-driven insights into customer behavior.

### Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Integration with Dynamics 365 (D365) and Salesforce CRMs.
  - Supporting SIP and WhatsApp for voice calls.
  - Advanced voice recognition using ML models.
  - Pre-determined offers manually entered into the chatbot system.
  - Configurable audience targeting by age, annual salary, and city.
  - Analytics on call success rates, human transfers, and negative customer responses.
  - Summary of conversations for human agents during call transfers.
  - Configurable call length.
  - Instant response time.
  - Issue logging sent to support for technical failures.
  - Happy path and unhappy path user stories.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Integration with systems not supporting SIP or WhatsApp voice calls.
  - Use of Large Language Models (LLMs).

- **Systems & Platforms**: Dynamics 365 CRM, Salesforce CRM, SIP-based systems, WhatsApp voice calling.

### Requirements
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Call initiation, interaction, and escalation based on customer responses.
  - Language supported: English.
  - Configurable call duration and audience targeting.
  - Voice recognition to analyze customer responses (yes/no).
  - Manual entry of pre-determined offers.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Instant response during interactions.
  - Analytics reporting for success rates, transfers, and negatives.
  - Logs and issue reporting for failures.
  - Cloud infrastructure setup.

### Functional Solution
- **Overview**: A chatbot-led sales call system integrated with CRM and call platforms, leveraging ML models.
- **Impact Assessment**: Improved sales conversion and reduced manual effort.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Cloud infrastructure will be available on time.
  - Access to a dataset for training ML models.
  - Offers are up-to-date and accurately entered.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Cloud infrastructure.
  - Dataset for ML models.
- **Entities**:
  - Chatbot, CRM systems, call platform, support team.

### Business Processes
- **AS IS**: Manual outbound sales calls with no automation.
- **TO BE**: Automated chatbot handling initial customer interaction with escalation to human agents when necessary.

### Stories
- **Stories List**: Covers happy path (successful interactions) and unhappy path (silent customers, irrelevant responses).
- **User Stories**: Focus first on a successful call lifecycle, then cover failures.

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Matrix**:
  - Reliance on cloud infrastructure readiness.
  - Availability of high-quality training dataset.
  - Technical issues with APIs for SIP/WhatsApp.
