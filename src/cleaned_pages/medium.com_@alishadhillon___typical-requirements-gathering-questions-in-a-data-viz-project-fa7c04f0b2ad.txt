Where do you begin? What will you ask? It is essential to have a requirements gathering before starting any project. It helps you better understand what exists, what you need and what you agree on achieving. It allows you to set expectations with the stakeholder from the start.There are many ways in which you can approach a requirements gathering. It is important that you tailor the questions to you and your organisation. You can always review your template before kick-off and ensure that it is to the point and specific to the individual project. In this post, I will share a few tips as well as a template for some requirements-gathering questions.Some Tips to an Effective Requirements Gathering TemplateInclude the 5 WsWhy — this helps you establish the purpose of the projectWhat — this allows you to establish the deliverablesWhen — this helps you to establish the project timingsWhere — this will help you in understanding where the data lives. It may also include where you intend to build the project or carry out any data preparationWho — this is about establishing the audienceHow — This question addresses access, and allows you to establish implementationGet them to give you a demo of the existing process, if they have oneIt is really easy for a stakeholder to say this is what I want. Quite often, you may learn that they have a process that they use to get the information that they need such as using a spreadsheet with multiple Excel charts and pivot tables. Seeing these charts or tables may influence the approach that you may need to take with your own dashboard, the filters you might need, and any calculations too. It is useful to know if you could optimise the data by doing any data preparation if they do use tools such as Tableau Prep, Alteryx etc.Establish what the definition of complete is for both partiesIt is really easy to do more or even deviate from the initial scope. Therefore, establishing what is regarded as ‘complete’ allows both parties to know where the line will be drawn. It also allows you to have a line to work towards within the time set for the project to take place.Rather than asking the stakeholder what they want, ask them what questions they would like answeredThe reality is, most stakeholders don’t truly know what they want, or at least struggle to explain it in a way that makes the most sense for an analyst to understand. It is a lot easier to ask them what the questions are that they would like answered. For example, a superstore may say that it would like to investigate its product inventory. Posing this as questions may lead to:How many external companies do we work with?How many products come from these external companies?How many products come from us?Is it cheaper for us to source products instead of external companies?How much extra do we pay on average for external products?These are all really valid questions that can help them make data-driven business decisions. They are more specific. We can already pick what data points we may need to investigate such as internal vs external products, products, and cost. We can also start to pick apart where calculations might be necessary such as finding an average. These questions are however missing a time period, so whilst this is more specific and helpful, it does lead the analyst to ask more questions.A Requirements Gathering Template DraftBelow is a very basic outline of some questions that have been helpful in carrying out a requirements gathering. It is worth adapting this to add more questions where you see fit. Often these questions lead to a broader discussion which can help you to better understand the project as a whole.Why — Establish the Purpose of the ProjectCan you describe what it is that you are trying to achieve?Could you demo this and share any resources of your existing solution?What are the questions that you would like answered?Are there any calculations that we need to be aware of?How will this add value to your team?What/ When — Establish the Deliverables/ Project TimingsWhat functionality do you want to include? Filters, drill downs?Are there any dashboard standards in place such as colour scheme, text, dashboard size etc?Are there any KPIs or benchmarks for this project?How often will check-ins take place? Establish a frequency.How long do we have to achieve the objective? Is there a deadline?What is the definition of completeWhere — Establishing the Data SourcesWhat data sources do we need and where are they from? Databases? Excels etc?Do we need access to the database or any software where the data may live?What additional data will be needed to complete the project e.g. benchmarks or targets from another source?Do we need to define any data points? Is there a data dictionary?Who — Establishing your AudienceWho will be the users of the solution?Do you need to add any security to hide views from certain members?Is anybody in your team colour-blind?Who is responsible for testing?How — Establishing ImplementationHow will you access the deliverable?How will you communicate what your content is to your audience?What documentation will be required?How often will you need the data to refresh?If others are expected to use it, will they know how or will you need to show them?As mentioned at the start, it is always important to review a template before kick-off to tailor it where need be. Hopefully, this serves as a starting point to then expand.RequirementsRequirements GatheringData VisualizationTableauDashboard----1Written by Alisha Dhillon107 followers·11 followingBusiness Intelligence Analyst | Ex DS21 | Tableau Public Featured Author 21 | 2x VOTD | @infolabuk @dataschooluk AlumniResponses (1)See all responsesHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech
